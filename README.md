# PathfindingAlgorithms

A simple yet effective showcase of pathfinding algorithms including A*, Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Searchâ€”all developed from scratch in C++. The project uses the SFML library to provide a lightweight GUI and real-time visualization, making it easier to observe and compare how each algorithm explores the search space and finds optimal paths.
